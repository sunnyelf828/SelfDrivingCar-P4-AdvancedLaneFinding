## Advanced Lane Finding

In this project, your goal is to write a software pipeline to identify the lane boundaries in a video, but the main output or product we want you to create is a detailed writeup of the project.  Creating a great writeup:

The goals / steps of this project are the following:

* Compute the **camera calibration matrix and distortion coefficients** given a set of chessboard images.
* Apply a **distortion correction** to raw images.
* Use color transforms, gradients, etc., to create a thresholded **binary image**.
* Apply a **perspective transform** to rectify binary image ("birds-eye view").
* **Detect** lane pixels and **fit** to find the lane boundary.
* **Determine the curvature** of the lane and vehicle position with respect to center.
* **Warp back** the detected lane boundaries onto the original image.
* Output visual display of the lane boundaries and numerical estimation of lane curvature and vehicle position.
